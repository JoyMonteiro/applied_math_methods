# Applied Mathematical Methods (EC3134)

This course is intended to give you a flavour of the kind
of scientific problems we encounter in the geosciences,
and the mathematical approaches that we use to model and
solve these problems.

The lectures will be added to the below list, and you can
view them as and when they are uploaded.

## Instructions for viewing lectures

On clicking the link for any lecture, you will be directed
to a [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) presentation. At the
bottom of the screen, you will find a play button. Press play,
sit back and let the magic of modern web technologies unfold!

If you want to start the audio from some slide in the middle,
just navigate to that slide (using arrow keys or the space bar),
and then press play. This is useful if you want to revisit some
part of the lecture skipping other parts.
